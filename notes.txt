*TODO*
1. Redo block diagram and high level requirements
2. Identify and prototype a video processor architecture
  a. Found processor architecture. Will use a soc with fpga and processor for one comptuer module. 
  For this unit, I will use either the zynq 7000 or the microcip microblaze.
  For the second processor board, I'll use a qualcomm snapdragon based processor with an additional fgpa on it to compare the 
  performance and cost between the two. 
3. Split project into two boards, a back plane and cpu board
4. Continue research on different interfaces and topologies to determine which ones are actually necessary
