Things to consider when selecting a processor
1. Availability
2. Has the interfaces I need
3. Does this include a fgpa?
4. Price, is this something I can get a sample of?
5. Software support, are there libraries available and plenty of documentation?
6. Hardware support, libraries available, good documentation and references?
